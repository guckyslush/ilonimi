This script is quite volatile. It's essentially a reskin of someone else's script, AutoHotKey is not my field...

To output a word, you have to press each key in its configuration at the same time.

KEYS (Turn your keyboard 90 degrees counterclockwise)

```
    [d]
[e]     [x]
    [s]
[w]     [z]
    [a]
```

You might get issues with the script spamming an output but it's not that big of a deal haha Preferably, this script's input method would be holding each key down and only outputting on release like an actual stenography keyboard, probably by using KeyWait. If you're interested in helping, please feel free to message me! Even if it's been years since I wrote this, if this message is still here, then I'm still happy to edit this script with someone who actually knows how to use AHK (not me).

F1 key toggles this script on and off
